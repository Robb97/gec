Milestone 1 <0.1.0> 12/10/2017
----------------------------
	New Functions
	-------------
	Added Clear to colour to set screen colour.
	Added Find Pixel function to determine 'star' location.
	Added Speed to determine movement of starfield.
	Stars now move towards screen to achieve desired effect.

	Code Additions
	-------------
	Clear_To_Colour : clears screen to desired colour (in this case black) 
		BYTE *Screen : pointer to screen
		int width : width of screen
		int height : height of screen
		int r, g, b : red, green and blue values

	Find_Pixel : determines placement of 'stars' and their size 
		float width : width of star
		float height : height of star
		int orgWidth : original width of screen
		int orgHeight : original height of screen
		int posX , posY : origin of cluster of stars
		BYTE *screenptr : pointer to screen

	Tests
	-----
	Added large amount of stars : adding >1.000,000 stars results in performance issues at 1900x1080 res. FPS @ 1920x1080 w/ 1M stars : 49
	Changed size of stars : star sizes of larger than 2x2 immediately effected FPS massively. FPS @ star size 10x10 : 7
	Changed speed : speed can be changed into the multiples of 1000s without putting FPS below 30. More taxing on eyes than the program at extreme speeds.

Version 0.1.1 13/10/2017
--------------
	New Functions
	-------------
	Added ability to change colour while running using keys R, B, G, P and Q (red, blue, green, purple and random).
	Added ability to change speed of stars using W and S.

	Code Additions
	--------------
	Edited the star struct to hold red green and blue values.
	Made use of HAPI function GetKeyboardData.

	Tests
	-----
	New functions worsen FPS considerably.
