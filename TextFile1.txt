Milestone 1 <0.1.0> 12/10/2017
----------------------------
	New Functions
	-------------
	Added Clear to colour to set screen colour.
	Added Find Pixel function to determine 'star' location.
	Added Speed to determine movement of starfield.
	Stars now move towards screen to achieve desired effect.

	Code Additions
	-------------
	Clear_To_Colour : clears screen to desired colour (in this case black) 
		BYTE *Screen : pointer to screen
		int width : width of screen
		int height : height of screen
		int r, g, b : red, green and blue values

	Find_Pixel : determines placement of 'stars' and their size 
		float width : width of star
		float height : height of star
		int orgWidth : original width of screen
		int orgHeight : original height of screen
		int posX , posY : origin of cluster of stars
		BYTE *screenptr : pointer to screen

	Tests
	-----
	Added large amount of stars : adding >1.000,000 stars results in performance issues at 1900x1080 res. FPS @ 1920x1080 w/ 1M stars : 49
	Changed size of stars : star sizes of larger than 2x2 immediately effected FPS massively. FPS @ star size 10x10 : 7
	Changed speed : speed can be changed into the multiples of 1000s without putting FPS below 30. More taxing on eyes than the program at extreme speeds.

Version 0.1.1 13/10/2017
--------------
	New Functions
	-------------
	Added ability to change colour while running using keys R, B, G, P and Q (red, blue, green, purple and random).
	Added ability to change speed of stars using W and S.

	Code Additions
	--------------
	Edited the star struct to hold red green and blue values.
	Made use of HAPI function GetKeyboardData.

	Tests
	-----
	New functions worsen FPS considerably.


Milestone 2 <0.2.0> 26/10/2017
----------------------------
	New Functions
	-------------
	Added Fast_Blit to draw a sprite to screen without alpha blending 
	Added Alpha_Blit to draw a sprite to screen with alpha blending
	Added Init_Texture to add texture using HAPI funciton
	Added Create_Sprite to load a sprite from a file using HAPI function
	Added Draw_Sprite to draw the loaded sprite(s)
	
	Code Addition
	-------------
	Created a Sprite class repsonsible for holding the blit functions
	Created a Visualisation class responsible for clearing to colour and handling the create and draw functions
	Used HAPIs keyboard handling to capture movement input from player

	Tests
	------
	Tested blitting : sprites are drawn to screen
	Tested Alpha Blitting : blends with background sprite
	Added a large amount of sprites : heavily reduced FPS


Milestone 3 <0.3.0> 08/11/17
---------------------------
	New Functions
	-------------
	added clip bit to sprite class,
	added rect.h with 
		translate to handle translating from source to screen and vice versa
		clip to to handle clipping into a destination rectangle
		contained to check a rectangle is within a rectangle
		outside to check if a rectangle is outside a rectangle

	Code Addition
	-------------
	Created a rect class to hold functions for the rectangles
	Added Clip Blit which uses the alpha blit function with clipping inserted into it

	Tests
	------
	Tested clipping : clips correctly

Milestone 3 <0.3.1> 09/11/17
----------------------------
	New Functions
	-------------
	Added Create Animate Sprite to handle relevant info from source file which can be passed to a rectangle and later used in the blit functions
	Added Clip Blit A(nimated) to blit using the frameRectangle which cycles through stages of animation in the source file

	Code Addition
	-------------
	Edited existing clip blit function to now use frameRectangle instead of rectangle based on source image, as to provide a single sprite, not the whole sheet.
	Clip bit with animation was remade into a seperate function, original clip bit re-added with frameRectangle as source

	Tests
	------
	Tested animation across whole screen : worked
	Added multiple sprites : heavy toll on fps
	tested other blit functions at the same time : works
